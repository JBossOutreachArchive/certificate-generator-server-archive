An automatic certificate generator for events according to multiple input files like csv, xlsx, numbers and shoots emails with generated certificates.

## Setting up environment

- Install pipenv

```sh
pip install pipenv
```

- Create a pipenv

```sh
pipenv shell
```

As soon as the shell is ready,

- Run the following command to install the dependencies

```sh
pipenv install
```

The above command will install all of the dependencies.

- Set up environmental variables using:

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```

Now edit .env and fill the generated `.env` file with your credentials to run it locally.

## Running

```sh
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py makemigrations api
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

To stop the server, press `Ctrl + C` and deactivate the virtual environment using `deactivate` command.

## Post setup instructions

Instead of adding new dependencies to requirements.txt, simply run:

```sh
pipenv install <package-name>
```

to install it inside pipenv and add it to Pipfile.

To lock the dependencies for deployment, run:

```sh
pipenv lock
```
